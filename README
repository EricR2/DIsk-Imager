Description: The main python file called main.py consists of four sections; first is the imported sections, 
second are the functions, third is the input parser(really is the second one tho), and fourth is what gets answers.
Original issues with getting the makefile to run python file under ./boo_info name, solution was to copy script 
into boot_info at runtime. Script will parse the input and create the hashed files preserving the file path then 
call on the python file with the parsed arguments. I wont get too much into the python fiel as it has comments. 
Only other thing worth explaining is the #!/usr/bin/env python3 to ensure interpreter uses python and #!/bin/bash
to specify bash as I was getting problems on my VM.
